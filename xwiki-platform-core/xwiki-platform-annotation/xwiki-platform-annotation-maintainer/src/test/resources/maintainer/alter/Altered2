# Modifying the whole content on which the annotation is added.
# Failing, which proves clearly the need for word based diffs, the users don't edit characters in documents but words
# The character based diffs don't overlap the whole annotation, some letters are synchronized
# either we consider that overlapping the start or end of annotation is altered too (which is not really the best idea)
